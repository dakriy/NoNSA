# No NSA
### A Peer-to-Peer chat client

No NSA is a simple p2p chat client that leverages the [keybase](https://keybase.io "Keybase.io") client to provide PGP encryption and verification of messages.

This project was developed as part of the Computer Security (CPTR 440) class at [Walla Walla Univeristy](https://wallawalla.edu "WWU") during the Fall 2016 term.
